voyageEmbeddingObjects
  ^ '"Objects can be as simple as associations of literals or more complex: 
objects can contain other objects, leading to a tree of objects. Saving 
such objects is as simple as sending the save message to them. For example, 
letâ€™s say that we want to create an Association of two points. As before we 
need to make sure that instances of Assocations are treated as a root object
by Voyage:

	Association class>>isVoyageRoot
		^ true"

assoc := 42@1 -> (10@20).
assoc save.

The association looks like the following when stored in GemStone:

	(class)@     -> TugrikObject
	(oop)@       -> 670637825
	(invariant)@ -> true
	(committed)@ -> true
	_id@         -> OID(579fc6f8391d54a8435b1635)
	_oidValue@   -> 27118354667247424203703129653
	#instanceOf@ -> #''Association''
	#version@    -> 1660957928
	key@         -> aDictionary( #''y''->1, ''#instanceOf''->#''Point'', #''x''->42)
	value@       -> aDictionary( #''y''->20, ''#instanceOf''->#''Point'', #''x''->10)

Note that each Point is represented by a Dictionary with x and y fields and #instanceOf Point.
